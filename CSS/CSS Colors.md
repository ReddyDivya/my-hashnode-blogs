**Hey Readers ** ðŸ‘‹

In this article, weâ€™ll learn about the **CSS Colors to beautify our content**. 

So, Let's dive into the article.

Modern browsers support 140 named colors.

There are **different color systems**. We can use them in our HTML and CSS by 

**name**, **Hex color code**, or **RGB value**.

Let me explain individually. 

### RGB Color

An RGB color value is specified with **rgb(red, green, blue)**.

Each parameter **(red, green, and blue)** defines the intensity of the color as an integer between **0** and **255**.

For example, **rgb(0, 255, 0) ** is rendered as **green**, because the green parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

Have a look on a snippet ðŸ‘‡ for more clarity, where a **div** is styled with **background-color** & **color** using **RGB Color**.

```
div {
    background-color: rgb(255, 87, 51);
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    padding: 20px;
}
``` 

Here's an output ðŸ‘‡

I hope you got some clarity on **RGB Color**. Now, let's get into the **Hexadecimal Colors**.

### Hexadecimal Colors

A hexadecimal color is specified with **#RRGGBB**.

**RR (red)**, **GG (green)**, and **BB (blue)** are hexadecimal integers between **00 ** and **FF ** specifying the intensity of the color.

For example, **#FF0000** is displayed as **red**, because the red component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.

Have a look on a snippet  ðŸ‘‡ for more clarity where a **div** is styled with **background-color** & **color** using **Hexadecimal Color**.

```
div {
    background-color: #FF3333;
    color: #ffffff;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

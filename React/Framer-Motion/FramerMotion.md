# Framer Motion

Intro
I'm really interested in doing some cool animations for your React projects.
Framer Motion is a fantastic library for animations in React. I've used it on a few projects, and it's been a game-changer. The API is super intuitive and allows us to create stunning animations with ease. We can smooth transitions like fading in elements or sliding them into view. We can give you app some extra touch of polish.

Let me walk you through the basics. First, you'll need to install it in your project. You can do that by running 

## Install

> npm install framer-motion or yarn add framer-motion. 

Once it's installed, you can import it into your components.

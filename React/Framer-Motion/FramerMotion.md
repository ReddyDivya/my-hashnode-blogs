Framer Motion is a fantastic library for animations in React. I've used it on a few projects, and it's been a game-changer. The API is super intuitive and allows us to create stunning animations with ease. We can do smooth transitions like fading in elements or sliding them into view. It can give your app some extra touch of polish.

It can really help you in creating some cool animations for your React projects.

Let's dive into the topic of animations in React using Framer Motion.

# What is Framer Motion?
Framer Motion is a free toolkit that helps developers make cool animations for their React apps. It's like a set of tools that makes creating animations easy.

With Framer Motion, you can make things <b>move, fade, and transform</b> on the screen in a <b>smooth and fancy way</b>. It works well with React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The best part is that Framer Motion uses a simple and clear way to write your animations. You can tell it <b>what to animate, how long it should take, and how it should look when it's done</b>. It's like giving instructions to a robot to make things move and change.

Overall, Framer Motion is a handy tool for React developers who want to add eye-catching animations to their apps without too much hassle.


Let me walk you through the basics. First, you'll need to install it in your project. You can do that by running 

# Install

```
npm install framer-motion 

(or)

yarn add framer-motion. 
```

Once it's installed, you can import it into your components.

# The motion component

The <b>motion</b> component is a key component provided by Framer Motion library. It is used as a wrapper around your existing React components to enable animation capabilities. The motion component enhances the specified component with animation-related features and props.

# How do we start animating elements using Framer Motion?

Framer Motion provides a range of components and hooks to create animations. One commonly used component is <b>motion.div</b>. You can wrap your JSX elements with it and apply animation props to achieve the desired effects.

One of the key features of Framer Motion is its intuitive API. It offers components like <b>motion.div</b>, <b>motion.button</b>, and <b>motion.svg</b> that can be used to wrap existing React elements and apply animations to them using props. It also provides hooks, such as <b>useAnimation</b> and <b>useMotionValue</b>, for more fine-grained control over animations.


#  Here are a few examples of animations you can create using Framer Motion in React

## Fading an element

```
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>
      Hello, world!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we set the initial opacity of the <b>div</b> to 0, and when the component mounts, it smoothly animates to an opacity of 1 over a duration of 1 second.

## Sliding an element into view

```
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div initial={{ x: -100 }} animate={{ x: 0 }}>
      Slide me!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

Here, the <b>div</b> starts positioned 100 pixels to the left (x: -100) and animates to its original position (x: 0), sliding into view from the left side of the screen.

![SlideIn](https://github.com/ReddyDivya/my-hashnode-blogs/assets/34181144/daaa2001-8790-49a5-9e7a-78d038c1c27a)


## Scaling an element on hover

```
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div whileHover={{ scale: 1. }}>
      Hover me!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

In this example, when you hover over the <b>div</b>, it scales up by 20% (scale: 1.2), giving it a zoom-in effect. When you move the mouse away, it returns to its original size smoothly.

Please, do have a look down below

That's really concise and powerful! Right?

I love how we can define the initial and target states. Let's see other animation properties that we can use.

Framer Motion provides a wide range of properties like <b>scale</b>, <b>rotate</b>, <b>translateX</b>, and many more to animate different aspects of an element. You can also use the transition prop to define the <b>duration, delay, and easing of the animation</b>.

Framer Motion offers some advanced features and tips to take our animations to the next level. Let me share a few with you.

# What are some of the advanced features?

## Spring-based animations in Framer Motion

Spring-based animations in Framer Motion allow us to create animations that feel more natural and bouncy, like objects in the real world.

In linear animations, elements move in a straight line at a constant speed. But with spring-based animations, we can make elements move in a more dynamic and lively way, as if they are being affected by forces like springs.

To achieve this effect, we can adjust properties like damping, stiffness, and mass. Damping controls how quickly the animation slows down, stiffness determines how rigid or bouncy the animation is, and mass affects the weightiness of the animation.

By tweaking these properties, we can create different behaviors for our animations. For example, we can have a subtle bounce effect or a more exaggerated and playful movement.

Using spring-based animations adds a touch of realism and interactivity to our user interfaces. It can make our animations feel more engaging and enjoyable for users, as they mimic the way objects move in the physical world.

That sounds really interesting! How do we implement spring-based animations in Framer Motion?

We can use the animate prop with the spring configuration. Here's an example

```
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -100 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ type: 'spring', damping: 10, stiffness: 100 }}
>
  Spring animation!
</motion.div>
```

In this example, we're using a spring animation for the animate prop. We can adjust the damping and stiffness values to fine-tune the animation's behavior.

That's awesome! Right?
It adds a dynamic and lively touch to the animations.

## Variants in Framer Motion

Framer Motion also offers variants, which are a powerful way to define reusable animation patterns. Variants allow us to create sets of animations and transitions that can be applied to multiple elements. We can define different states and transitions for each variant, making it easier to manage complex animations and maintain a consistent design language throughout our app.

That sounds incredibly useful! Let's see, how do we define and use variants in Framer Motion?

We can define a variant object with named sets of animation properties and transitions, and then apply those variants to our elements. Here's an example

```
const boxVariants = {
  initial: { opacity: 0 },
  animate: { opacity: 1 },
  hover: { scale: 1.2 },
};

<motion.div
  variants={boxVariants}
  initial="initial"
  animate="animate"
  whileHover="hover"
>
  Variant animation!
</motion.div>

```

In this example, we define a boxVariants object with three variants: initial, animate, and hover. We can apply these variants using the variants prop on the motion.div component. By specifying the initial and animate variants, the animation will play when the component mounts. Additionally, when hovering over the component, it will apply the hover variant with a scale effect.

Wow, variants seem incredibly handy! They make it easier to manage and reuse animation patterns. Anything else we should know?

One more tip is to explore the use of custom transitions. Framer Motion allows us to define our own custom transitions, giving us full control over the animation easing, delays, and more. It allows us to create unique and personalized animations tailored to our specific needs.

That's a great tip! Custom transitions can definitely add a personal touch to our animations. You'll definitely explore that.

## Custom transitions in Framer Motion

Custom transitions in Framer Motion allow us to define and use our own animation transitions, giving us full control over how elements animate and interact. Let's explore the use of custom transitions in more detail.

To create a custom transition, we can define our own animation variants using the variants prop. Each variant represents a different state of the animation. Within each variant, we can specify the desired animation properties and transitions.

Here's an example:

```
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const customTransition = {
  duration: 0.5,
  ease: [0.6, 0.01, -0.05, 0.9],
};

const variants = {
  initial: { opacity: 0 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, transition: customTransition },
  exit: { opacity: 0, transition: customTransition },
};

function CustomTransitionsExample() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      variants={variants}
      initial="initial"
      animate="animate"
      exit="exit"
    >
      Custom Transitions
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we define a custom transition named customTransition, which has a duration of 0.5 seconds and uses a custom cubic-bezier easing curve defined by the array [0.6, 0.01, -0.05, 0.9].

Then, we define a set of animation variants within the variants object. The initial variant sets the initial opacity to 0, the animate variant sets the opacity to 1 with the custom transition, and the exit variant sets the opacity to 0 with the same custom transition.

By using custom transitions, we have complete control over the animation properties, easing curves, durations, delays, and other parameters. This allows us to create unique and tailored animation effects that align perfectly with our design goals and user experience.

![CustomTransition](https://github.com/ReddyDivya/my-hashnode-blogs/assets/34181144/3ef5978c-e438-4d13-8cd2-fa0398b3fe5b)

## Drag in framer-motion

To enable dragging functionality in Framer Motion, you can use the drag prop on the motion component. This allows you to make your components draggable with customizable options. Here's an example of how to use drag in Framer Motion.

```
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      drag
	  dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, bottom: 0 }}
	  dragElastic={1.0}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example:

The drag prop enables dragging functionality on the component.
The dragConstraints prop sets the boundaries within which the component can be dragged. By setting the values to { left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, bottom: 0 }, the component can be dragged within the boundaries of its parent container.
The dragElastic prop determines the elasticity of the dragging motion. A value of 1.0 means the component will snap back to its original position if released within a short distance from its starting point.

Please, do have a look down below

![Drag](https://github.com/ReddyDivya/my-hashnode-blogs/assets/34181144/e003b453-5dfd-49e6-a87e-741917f6bd03)

You can further customize the dragging behavior by using additional props.

dragTransition: Defines the transition animation when the component is dragged. 
For example, you can set { bounceStiffness: 300, bounceDamping: 10 } to create a bouncy effect when releasing the component.

dragMomentum: Determines whether the dragging motion has momentum after releasing. Set it to false to disable momentum.

onDragStart, onDrag, onDragEnd: Event callbacks that allow you to perform actions based on drag events.

```
<motion.div
  drag
  dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, bottom: 0 }}
  dragElastic={0.5}
  dragTransition={{ bounceStiffness: 300, bounceDamping: 10 }}
  dragMomentum={false}
  onDragStart={() => console.log('Drag started')}
  onDrag={() => console.log('Dragging')}
  onDragEnd={() => console.log('Drag ended')}
/>
```

By combining these props and event callbacks, you can create interactive and customizable dragging experiences with Framer Motion. Feel free to adjust the values and explore other options based on your specific requirements.

# Framer Motion

Intro
I'm really interested in doing some cool animations for our React projects.
Framer Motion is a fantastic library for animations in React. I've used it on a few projects, and it's been a game-changer. The API is super intuitive and allows us to create stunning animations with ease. We can smooth transitions like fading in elements or sliding them into view. We can give our app some extra touch of polish.

# Framer Motion

Intro
I'm really interested in doing some cool animations for your React projects.
Framer Motion is a fantastic library for animations in React. I've used it on a few projects, and it's been a game-changer. The API is super intuitive and allows us to create stunning animations with ease. We can smooth transitions like fading in elements or sliding them into view. We can give you app some extra touch of polish.

Let me walk you through the basics. First, you'll need to install it in your project. You can do that by running 

## Install

> npm install framer-motion or yarn add framer-motion. 

Once it's installed, you can import it into your components.

## So, How do we start animating elements using Framer Motion?

Framer Motion provides a range of components and hooks to create animations. One commonly used component is motion.div. You can wrap your JSX elements with it and apply animation props to achieve the desired effects.

## Let me give an example of fading in an element using Framer Motion

Let's say you have a <div> that you want to fade in when the component mounts. You can do something like this:
